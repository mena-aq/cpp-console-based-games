# C-console-based-games
A collection of console based games I made using C++!

# Games :
## Connect-4
Where 2 players compete to make a row of their tokens (horizontally,vertically or diagonally)
```
g++ connect4.cpp
```

## Minesweeper
A simple minesweeper game using an 8x8 board. The number of adjacent mines is shown, where -1 denotes a mine. Uses zero indexing.
```
g++ minesweeper.cpp
```

## Sequence Game
Recall the sequence of numbers and enter them, for up to 10 numbers.
```
g++ sequenceGame.cpp
```

## Snake Game
My personal favourite! A character based interpretation of the popular snake game, where snake segments are depicted by 'o''s and the apple by '@'. Move using A,W,S,D.
```
g++ snake.cpp
```
## Tic-Tac-Toe
2 player tic-tac-toe, using 'O' and 'X'. 
```
g++ tictactoe.cpp
```
